# SteamCMD in Docker optimized for Unraid
This Docker will download and install SteamCMD. It will also install CoreKeeper and run it.

**GameID:** Your GameID will be displayed in the log after the server successfully started.

**Port Forwarding:** You don't have to forward any ports for this game because it uses the Steam Network and the GameID to establish the connection.

Update Notice: Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.
